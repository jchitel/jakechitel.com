I was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I have always had
a deep interest in math, science, and technology, which led me
to enroll in [engineering classes](https://www.pltw.org/)
in high school (thus breaking the fourth seal of STEM and
fulfilling the prophecy). In my junior year I took a class on
Digital Electronics, which gave me a solid foundation of how
computer hardware works and pointed my interest solidly in the
direction of computers. As a senior I taught myself Java
to <span className="line-through">
start the next generation of enterprise software</span>
learn how to make Minecraft mods. Learning how to code sealed my fate as
a software junkie.

I got a BS in Computer Engineering at Marquette University in
Milwaukee (class of 2015). I was extremely fortunate at the
beginning of my freshman year to get a job as a Software
Developer at the GasDay Lab (now called
[Marquette Energy Analytics](https://marquetteenergyanalytics.com/)).
It was here that I learned practical software development
(C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some good ol' VB6)
over the course of my 4 years in college, in parallel with
learning theory (data structures, circuits, operating systems,
computer hardware, networks, embedded systems, compilers, etc.)
in my classes.

My first summer internship was at [Quad/Graphics](https://www.quad.com/)
in Sussex, WI, in 2013, where I continued to use a lot of the
same tech that I was using at GasDay. I decided to shoot big for
my last summer internship and landed a gig at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
(yes, that Amazon) in Seattle, WA. As an intern at Amazon I
worked on an ingestion system for [wireless plans](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=20429280011),
utilizing SQL, Java, and Ruby.

My mad skills as an intern landed me a full-time position at
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) after graduation, where I worked
on the console (web UI) for the [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
service. It was here that I was exposed to the wide and
wonderful world of web development. I learned Angular (the old
one), REST APIs, Grunt, and Gulp, and began a passionate tryst
with JavaScript that has blossomed to a loving relationship
today.

I started getting into web development at the perfect time, as
2015 was right when web tooling and frameworks underwent a
complete overhaul. Our codebase started as a typical
old-fashioned Angular app with manually managed vendor scripts
and a large Gulpfile. By the time I left AWS just a year later,
I had seen the entire app converted to ES2015, React with Redux,
NPM for managing dependencies, and NodeJS, Babel, and Webpack
for builds. My team was among the first AWS console teams to
embrace React, and our project set the stage for other teams to
adopt it not long after. I learned more than I can possibly list
while working at AWS, and my short time there established my
still-growing passion for web development.

After attempting to set my own roots on the other side of the
country, I decided that my home was still Milwaukee, so I moved
back in June 2016. I was unable to take the AWS job with me, but
I absolutely would have if given the opportunity (if I had left
in 2020, things would likely have gone quite differently...). It
took a while to find my footing in MKE, and I tried a few
different companies (D+H, now called [Finastra](https://www.finastra.com/),
and [GE HealthCare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/)). It was at
[Direct Supply](https://www.directsupply.com/)(my current employer)
that I found a good fit. I was brought back to my .NET roots,
and was introduced to TypeScript (as the adage goes, I cannot go back).

Over the course of the last few years, I have been able to
mature as an engineer. I have faced significant challenges and
have grown from them. I have built confidence as a team member.
I have had the opportunity to provide mentorship to junior
engineers. Perhaps the most significant project I have worked on
at Direct Supply was a complete rewrite of a legacy mobile
application, which provided many learning opportunities, both
technical and non-technical.

As I look to the future of my career, I plan to deepen my web
development skills, try new technologies, work with people from
all walks of life, engage more in open source, and continue to
grow as an engineer and as a person. Look for big things from me
and those with whom I work!
